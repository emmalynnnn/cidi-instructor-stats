# Instructor Stats Project
* Developed by Emma Lynn (a02391851@usu.edu)
* Supervised by Neal Legler, CIDI Director (neal.legler@usu.edu)
* On request from Nikole Eyre, Senior Lecturer - English Department

Note: This script is very specific to pulling the data we needed in this case, but it would be very easy to adapt
it for another instructor's use case.
